SMTP
CODE
MEANING
HOW TO SOLVE IT / WHAT TO DO



101
The server is unable to connect.
Try to change the server's name (maybe it was spelt incorrectly) or the connection port.
111
Connection refused or inability to open an SMTP stream.
This error normally refers to a connection issue with the remote SMTP server, depending on firewalls or misspelled domains. Double-check all the configurations and in case ask your provider.



211
System status message or help reply.
It comes with more information about the server.
214
A response to the HELP command.
It contains information about your particular server, normally pointing to a FAQ page.
220
The server is ready.
It's just a welcome message. Just read it and be happy that everything is working (so far)!
221
The server is closing its transmission channel. It can come with side messages like "Goodbye" or "Closing connection".
The mailing session is going to end, which simply means that all messages have been processed.
250
Its typical side message is "Requested mail action okay completed": meaning that the server has transmitted a message.
The oppsite of an error: everything has worked and your email has been delivered.
251
"User not local will forward": the recipient's account is not on the present server, so it will be relayed to another.
It's a normal transfer action. For other information check out our article on what is an SMTP server.
252
The server cannot verify the user, but it will try to deliver the message anyway.
The recipient's email account is valid, but not verifiable. Normally the server relays the message to another one that will be able to check it.



354
The side message can be very cryptic ("Start mail input end <CRLF>.<CRLF>"). It's the typical response to the DATA command.
The server has received the "From" and "To" details of the email, and is ready to get the body message.



420
"Timeout connection problem": there have been issues during the message transfer.
This error message is produced only by GroupWise servers. Either your email has been blocked by the recipient's firewall, or there's a hardware problem. Check with your provider.
421
The service is unavailable due to a connection problem: it may refer to an exceeded limit of simultaneous connections, or a more general temporary problem.
The server (yours or the recipient's) is not available at the moment, so the dispatch will be tried again later.
422
The recipient's mailbox has exceeded its storage limit.
Best is to contact contact the user via another channel to alert him and ask to create some free room in his mailbox.
431
Not enough space on the disk, or an "out of memory" condition due to a file overload.
This error may depend on too many messages sent to a particular domain. You should try again sending smaller sets of emails instead of one big mail-out.
432
Typical side-message: "The recipient's Exchange Server incoming mail queue has been stopped".
It's a Microsoft Exchange Server's SMTP error code. You should contact it to get more information: generally it's due to a connection problem.
441
The recipient's server is not responding.
There's an issue with the user's incoming server: yours will try again to contact it.
442
The connection was dropped during the transmission.
A typical network connection problem, probably due to your router: check it immediately.
446
The maximum hop count was exceeded for the message: an internal loop has occurred.
Ask your SMTP provider to verify what has happened.
447
Your outgoing message timed out because of issues concerning the incoming server.
This happens generally when you exceeded your server's limit of number of recipients for a message. Try to send it again segmenting the list in different parts.
449
A routing error.
Like error 432, it's related only to Microsoft Exchange. Use WinRoute.
450
"Requested action not taken – The user's mailbox is unavailable". The mailbox has been corrupted or placed on an offline server, or your email hasn't been accepted for IP problems or blacklisting.
The server will retry to mail the message again, after some time. Anyway, verify that is working on a reliable IP address.
451
"Requested action aborted – Local error in processing". Your ISP's server or the server that got a first relay from yours has encountered a connection problem.
It's normally a transient error due to a message overload, but it can refer also to a rejection due to a remote antispam filter. If it keeps repeating, ask your SMTP provider to check the situation. (If you're sending a large bulk email with a free one that can be a common issue).
452
Too many emails sent or too many recipients: more in general, a server storage limit exceeded.
Again, the typical cause is a message overload. Usually the next try will succeed: in case of problems on your server it will come with a side-message like "Out of memory".
471
An error of your mail server, often due to an issue of the local anti-spam filter.
Contact your SMTP service provider to fix the situation.



500
A syntax error: the server couldn't recognize the command.
It may be caused by a bad interaction of the server with your firewall or antivirus. Read carefully their instructions to solve it.
501
Another syntax error, not in the command but in its parameters or arguments.
In the majority of the times it's due to an invalid email address, but it can also be associated with connection problems (and again, an issue concerning your antivirus settings).
502
The command is not implemented.
The command has not been activated yet on your own server. Contact your provider to know more about it.
503
The server has encountered a bad sequence of commands, or it requires an authentication.
In case of "bad sequence", the server has pulled off its commands in a wrong order, usually because of a broken connection. If an authentication is needed, you should enter your username and password.
504
A command parameter is not implemented.
Like error 501, is a syntax problem; you should ask your provider.
510/511
Bad email address.
One of the addresses in your TO, CC or BBC line doesn't exist. Check again your recipients' accounts and correct any possible misspelling.
512
A DNS error: the host server for the recipient's domain name cannot be found.
Check again all your recipients' addresses: there will likely be an error in a domain name (like mail@domain.coom instead of mail@domain.com).
513
"Address type is incorrect": another problem concerning address misspelling. In few cases, however, it's related to an authentication issue.
Doublecheck your recipients' addresses and correct any mistake. If everything's ok and the error persists, then it's caused by a configuration issue (simply, the server needs an authentication).
523
The total size of your mailing exceeds the recipient server's limits.
Re-send your message splitting the list in smaller subsets.
530
Normally, an authentication problem. But sometimes it's about the recipient's server blacklisting yours, or an invalid email address.
Configure your settings providing a username+password authentication. If the error persists, check all your recipients' addresses and if you've been blacklisted.
541
The recipient address rejected your message: normally, it's an error caused by an anti-spam filter.
Your message has been detected and labeled as spam. You must ask the recipient to whitelist you.
550
It usually defines a non-existent email address on the remote side.
Though it can be returned also by the recipient's firewall (or when the incoming server is down), the great majority of errors 550 simply tell that the recipient email address doesn't exist. You should contact the recipient otherwise and get the right address.
551
"User not local or invalid address – Relay denied". Meaning, if both your address and the recipient's are not locally hosted by the server, a relay can be interrupted.
It's a (not very clever) strategy to prevent spamming. You should contact your ISP and ask them to allow you as a certified sender. Of course, with a professional SMTP provider like turboSMTP you won't ever deal with this issue.
552
"Requested mail actions aborted – Exceeded storage allocation": simply put, the recipient's mailbox has exceeded its limits.
Try to send a lighter message: that usually happens when you dispatch emails with big attachments, so check them first.
553
"Requested action not taken – Mailbox name invalid". That is, there's an incorrect email address into the recipients line.
Check all the addresses in the TO, CC and BCC field. There should be an error or a misspelling somewhere.
554
This means that the transaction has failed. It's a permanent error and the server will not try to send the message again.
The incoming server thinks that your email is spam, or your IP has been blacklisted. Check carefully if you ended up in some spam lists, or rely on a professional SMTP service like turboSMTP that will nullify this problem.

Error Name	Description	Explanation
ECONNABORTED	Software caused connection abort
ECONNREFUSED	Connection refused	Socket connection. The host refused service for some reason. This error is usually caused by a server process not being present at the requested name.
ECONNRESET	Connection reset by peer	TCP. The remote peer forced the session to be closed.
EISCONN	Socket is already connected	IP and UDP. An attempt was made to establish a connection on a socket that already has one or an attempt was made to send a datagram with the destination address specified and the socket is already connected. TCP. An attempt was made to establish a connection on a socket that already has one.
ENETDOWN	Network is down	Socket connection. Status information received by the client host from the underlying communication services indicates the net or the remote host is down.
ENETRESET	Network dropped connection on reset
ENETUNREACH	Network is unreachable
ENOBUFS	No buffer space available	TCP, IP, and UDP. Any Socket Operation. The system lacks sufficient memory for an internal data structure.

ESHUTDOWN	Cannot send after socket shutdown
ETIMEDOUT	Connection timed out	Socket connection. After failing to establish a connection during a period of time (excessive retransmissions), the system decided there was no point in retrying any more. The cause for this error is usually that the remote host is down or that problems in the network resulted in transmissions being lost.

Miscellaneous errors

Error Name	Description	Explanation
EHOSTDOWN	Host is down	Socket connection. Status information received by the client host from the underlying communication services indicates the net or the remote host is down.
EHOSTUNREACH	No route to host	Socket connection. These operational errors can occur either because the network or host is unknown (no route to the host or network is present) or because status information to that effect has been delivered to the client host by the underlying communication services.
ENOPROTOOPT	Protocol not available

GENERAL ERRORS

0x800CCC00 LOAD SICILY FAILED - Authentication did not load.

Try closing and restarting Outlook express

If still getting same error, wait 20-30 minutes for a server reset of your account then try again

It could be a corruption of the user account in Outlook Express. Try setting up a second identity and see if it works

0x800CCC01 INVALID CERTIFICATE CONTENT

Get your certificate re-issued by your authority server

0x800CCC02 INVALID CERTIFICATE DATE

Get your certificate re-issued by your authority server

0x800CCC03 USER ALREADY CONNECTED

You may be logged in on another machine. Close all connections on all machines, wait 20-30 minutes and try again

Some mail servers will not recognise an improper disconnection. This will result in the account being 'Poplocked'. Either wait 20-30 minutes for it to time out or get somebody to shell into the mail server and stop the mail task that is running on the account. This can normally only be done with accounts that have UNIX shells

If you are not logged in on another machine or poplocked then someone may be using/downloading from your account or something is wrong with your account

This is a possible corruption of the pop3uidl file. Close the Internet connection and all programs. Search for the file 'pop3uidl and delete it. Reconnect and it should work

Repeat step 1 with a reboot before you check your mail again

You may have a corrupt or a very large file attachment on the mail server. Large file attachments, mail that are missing headers or mail that do not conform to the mail RFC's can cause this

0x800CCC0B SERVER OR MAILDROP IS BUSY

Try to retrieve e-mail about once every 5 minutes. Alternatively, call your ISP help desk to make sure that the server hasn't crashed

You may be logged in on another machine. Close all connections on all machines, wait 20-30 minutes and then try again

Some mail servers will not recognise an improper disconnection. This will result in the account being 'Poplocked'. Either wait 20-30 minutes for it to time out or get somebody to shell into the mail server and stop the mail task that is running on the account. This can normally only be done with accounts that have UNIX shells

If you are not logged in on another machine or poplocked then someone may be using/downloading from your account or something is wrong with your account

0x800CCC0C NOT INIT

0x800CCC0D CANT FIND HOST - Cannot locate server

This error can appear if you have 'notify me if there are any new newsgroups' selected but don't have a news account set up. Go to TOOLS > OPTIONS > GENERAL TAB and untick this option.

If you cannot get web pages then hang up and try connecting again

Reboot the computer and try again

If it's still not working and you are not getting any web pages, then data may not be moving across the network properly. Check DNS numbers, remove and then reinstall TCP/IP in Control Panel > Network.

0x800CCC16 INVALID ACCOUNT - User account not recognised

Check the spelling of the account name and re-enter the password taking care to spell it correctly.

0x800CCC17 USER CANCEL

You have pressed the cancel button

You may have mail that are missing headers, mail that does not conform to the mail RFC's or a corrupt or very large file attachment on the mail server.

If you pressed cancel because it is taking a long while or is timing out then the pop3uidl file may be corrupted. Close your Internet connection and all other programs. Find and delete the file, pop3uidl, reconnect and try it again.

If still the same error then repeat step 3, and reboot before trying to check the mail again.

0x800CCC18 SICILY LOGON FAILED - Logon attempt failed

Check account information, making sure account is not case sensitive, close Outlook Express, restart the computer and try reconnecting.

Create a different identity and see if it will logon on from this identity with the same information.

Make sure the account is still active with the ISP and that the ISP is not having an e-mail outllook.

0x800CCC19 TIMEOUT

This is a possible corruption of the pop3uidl file. Close the Internet connection and all programs. Search for the file 'pop3uidl and delete it. Reconnect and it should work
