2.shared tenancy vulnerabilities, 
3.poor access controls, 
4.misconfigurations.

Use cloud service policies to ensure resources default as private
Audit access logs with automated tools to identify overly-exposed data;
Restrict sensitive data to approved storage and use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions to enforce these restrictions.

Cloud Security Checklist
------------------------
1. Set password policies
2. Make multi-factor authentication mandatory
3.Manage SaaS access and permissions
4. Enable anti-phishing protections
5. Turn on unintended external reply warning
6. Set external sharing standards
7. Set up message encryption
8. Set up data loss prevention policies
9. Enable mobile management
10. Run a security health/score audit
